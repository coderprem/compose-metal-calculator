![metal-calculator](https://github.com/coderprem/compose-metal-calculator/assets/106749140/bd0a735d-7be5-4e51-b5f7-032b2ebdb4fd)

## Overview
The Metal Calculator App is a practical tool built using Jetpack Compose. It helps users, especially those in the metalworking industry, to calculate various metal properties quickly and efficiently. This project was developed to reinforce my understanding of Jetpack Compose and to recreate an app that my dad uses for work.

## Features
- User-friendly UI built with Jetpack Compose
- Quick and efficient calculations for metal properties
- Designed for ease of use in a work environment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Giraffe (2022.3.1) or later
- Kotlin 1.5.21 or later

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/coderprem/compose-metal-calculator.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

## Future Improvements
- **Smooth Experience**: Further optimization to make the app more responsive and user-friendly.
- **Room Database Integration**: Plan to add Room dependency to manage persistent data storage efficiently.

## Architecture
As the project grows, managing files and lines of code can become challenging. To address this, I am considering adopting the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to better organize and manage the codebase.

## Contributing
I am open to suggestions and feedback from the community. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. Your insights will be invaluable as I continue to improve the app.
